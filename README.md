sinopia-offline-sync
===================

I didn't make this. perfectsquircle made this as documented [here](https://github.com/rlidwka/sinopia/issues/79), I just modified it to use streams instead of parsing the whole json file in memory.

It imports all packages from a central registry into the sinopia format.
